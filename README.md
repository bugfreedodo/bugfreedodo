# BugFreeDodo

Learning to code one bug at a time, with questionable amounts of enthusiasm.  
Currently building stuff on freeCodeCamp and vibing through the chaos.

I'm not an actual dodo. Just here to make the internet a little more fun.  
Still can't change the tweet source labelâ€”but hey, I'm working on it.

Stick around. Things are about to get interesting.
